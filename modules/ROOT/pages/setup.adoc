== Setup the Development Environment

=== Requirements

- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (newer versions may work, but are untested)
- At least 100 GB of free disk space

=== Consoles

Versal has two UART port. UART0 and UART1.  Our software by default
assign UART0 to APU and UART1 to RPU.

This means that, on SC-OBC Module V1 Development Board, `CON6` USB
Type 3 carries these UART lines.  CON6 is connected to FT4232H, which
bundles 4 ports.

This means that on your Linux development PC, you usually see:

- USB-Serial PORT 1: /dev/ttyUSB0: JTAG
- USB-Serial PORT 2: /dev/ttyUSB1: Versal UART0 (U-Boot and Linux Console)
- USB-Serial PORT 3: /dev/ttyUSB2: Versal UART1 (Zephyr Console)
- USB-Serial PORT 4: /dev/ttyUSB3: IGLOO2 UART
